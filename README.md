# WGU_Parcel_Delivery
Python Nearest Neighbor Delivery Service

Developed a Python-based application for the Western Governors University Parcel Service (WGUPS) to determine efficient routes and delivery schedules for daily local deliveries, ensuring all packages are delivered on time while maintaining total travel distance under 140 miles.

Key Features and Competencies:
Algorithm Design and Implementation:
Applied the nearest neighbor algorithm to solve the traveling salesman problem in the context of package delivery.
Evaluated alternative algorithms (Ant Colony Optimization, Genetic Algorithm) for potential improvements.

Data Structures:
Implemented a hash table for efficient storage and retrieval of package data, achieving O(1) average time complexity.
Analyzed alternative data structures (linked list, binary search tree).

Software Development:
Developed modular, maintainable code using Python and PyCharm IDE, with a clear separation of concerns.

Complexity Analysis:
Assessed the time and space complexity of the algorithm and data structures, ensuring scalability and efficiency using big-O notation.

User Interface Design:
Proposed a graphical user interface (GUI) for improved user interaction and real-time data visualization.

Real-Time Data Handling:
Suggested mechanisms for integrating real-time updates and external data sources to dynamically adjust delivery routes.

Tools and Technologies:
